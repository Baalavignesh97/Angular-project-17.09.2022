    Join us at Skill Safari as we rush into the new era of e-learning, where
    boring classroom education is not the ruler. We are here to provide you with
    knowledge and skills that make you think and help you build a new and better
    future. Learning how to code is the same. The first attempt to code will be
    quite difficult, but with every attempt you make you get better. If learning
    programs is hard you can still grasp the crucial basics ists using a visual
    coding language. It's possible for you to make your own Mario game without
    typing a single line of code
